			<p>
				Buford was originally a project meant to do various mathematical 
				functions. I eventually decided to create an algebra bot 
				(<a href="https://c1uq.github.io/buford">bu.bot.alge</a>) inside 
				this library, but it was very poorly written so hence: <em>Buford2</em>.
				Buford's main functionality will be to solve algebraic equations; 
				it will be able to determine <em>what tools to use and how 
				to use them</em> to get the 
				desired output. This JavaScript program will have a general 
				function which tries to detect the problem and how to solve it,
				and more specified user-friendly functions if you already know what needs 
				to be done to solve the problem and don't want to use extra processes.
				While still incomplete, the code I have written so far was cloned 
				<a href="https://github.com/c1uq/buford2">here</a>.
