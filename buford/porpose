GOALS--
    *ability to compile equation as string into computable state
    *ability to detect what algorithms need to be used to solve the equation
    *ability to read multiple different forms of syntax as input
    *ability to solve complex problems with forms of debugging to follow algorithm process in case of error
    *read numbers and variables together such as "2a"
    *add like terms to produce simplest output without carring numbers
    *add terms on opposite sides of the equation
    *distribute into addible portions
    *raise powers of variables
    *divide variables
    *multiply with *
    *be able to get certain variable alone in problems with more than one variable

RELEASE--
    *0.0.1- release bu.bot.alge for interpreting syntax, debugging, reading numbers and variables together, adding like terms, adding terms on opposite side of the equation
    *0.0.2- update bu.bot.alge for bug fixes, distributing into addible portions
    *0.0.3- update bu.bot.alge for bug fixes (can now distribute multiple different distributable portions)
